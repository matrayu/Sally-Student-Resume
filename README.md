Resume challenge
To close out this checkpoint, your challenge is to create a web page for Sally Student's resume, focusing on using semantic HTML. We'd like you to use this fictional character and not yourself so you don't get bogged down in perfecting the information in the resume.

Create a new repl.it for your challenge. Title it, "Sally Student resume". When you complete the challenge, submit the link to your repl.it in the field at the bottom of the page.

This is your first graded challenge. When you submit the link to your repl.it, a member of the grading team will review your work and respond with feedback. If you've met the requirements for the challenge, you'll move on to the next checkpoint. If not, the grading team will ask you to update your work and resubmit it for another review.

Requirements

Use semantic HTML throughout the page. At a minimum you should use: <header>, <main>, <section>, and <address> (which you can read up on here).

Include a page title (aka, use a <title> element) and meta description in the head. You should include these in all public facing web pages you create because they help web crawlers understand your page and contribute to search engine optimization.

There should be a contact info section with the following information about Sally:
Name
Email address (make one up) as a link
Phone number (make one up)
A picture (feel free to choose one or use this image of Ilana from Broad City) as a stand-in for Sally.

There should be a section for Sally's education, and it should list at least one college she attended.

There should be a section for Sally's employment history, and it should contain at least two entries. Each entry should show the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a short description of the job (for this last bit, feel free to use lorem ipsum filler text).
